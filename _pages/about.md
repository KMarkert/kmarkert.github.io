Hi! I am a computational Earth scientist that focuses on using computers to address challenges regarding our Earth and environment. My focus is largely on geospatial modeling and water resource management challenges but have experience in disaster management/response, food security and agriculture, and land cover/ecosystems. Using satellite remote sensing data and models, I conduct scientific analyses to help stakeholders better understand the Earth as a system in data-sparse regions or apply these technologies to streamline environmental monitoring for better decision making. I am an avid supporter of open source software and actively contribute to Python software projects while also posting my own code.

I have a master's degree in Earth System Science from the University of Alabama in Huntsville and am currently pursing a master's of business administration (MBA) with a focus on technology and innovation management. I currently work as a Research Scientist as part of the [Earth System Science Center](https://www.uah.edu/essc) at the University of Alabama in Huntsville on a NASA project called [SERVIR](https://servirglobal.net). At SERVIR, I lead the water resource activities while also working to translate the needs from our science team into geospatial applications; this includes scientific algorithm development, geospatial data processing, building and deploying web applications, and software development management.
