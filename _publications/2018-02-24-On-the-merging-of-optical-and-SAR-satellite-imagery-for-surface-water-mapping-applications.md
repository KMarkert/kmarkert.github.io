This paper is about using optical (Landsat 8) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (Sentinel-1) data together to provide  dense time series of surface water maps. The method was applied in the Mekong Basin, a cloud-prone region. Future work includes updating the algorithm to match histogram values and include more sensors, such as Sentinel-2.
