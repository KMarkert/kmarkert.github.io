This research aims to investigate how the land cover change will affect hydrologic parameters both spatially and temporally within the Lower Mekong Basin. The research goal is achieved by (1) modeling land cover change for a baseline land cover change scenario as well as changes in land cover with increases in forest or agriculture and (2) using modeled land cover data as inputs into the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to simulate the changes to the hydrologic system. The VIC model outputs were analyzed against historic values to understand to what degree land cover changes affect the hydrology of the region and where within the region these changes occur.
