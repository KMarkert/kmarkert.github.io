To augment *in situ* SSSC data from the current monitoring program, we developed an empirical model to estimate SSSC across the Lower Mekong Basin from Landsat observations. Model validation revealed that remotely sensed SSSC estimates captured the spatial and temporal dynamics in a range of aquatic environments (main stem of Mekong river, tributary systems, Mekong Floodplain, and reservoirs) while, on average, slightly underestimating SSSC by about 2 mg·L−1 across all settings. The operational SSSC model was developed and implemented using Google Earth Engine and Google App Engine was used to host an online application that allows users, without any knowledge of remote sensing, to access SSSC data across the region.
