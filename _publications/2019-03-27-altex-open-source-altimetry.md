Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of hydrologic variables, such as streamflow, is important for sustainable development, especially with global population growth and climate variations. Typical monitoring of streamflow is conducted using in situ gauging stations; however, stations are costly to setup and maintain, leading to data gaps in regions that cannot afford gauges. Satellite data, including altimetry data, are used to supplement in situ observations and in some cases supply information where they are lacking. This study introduces an open-source web application to access and explore altimetry datasets for use in water level monitoring, named the Altimetry Explorer (AltEx). This web application, along with its relevant REST API, facilitates access to altimetry data for analysis, visualization, and impact.
